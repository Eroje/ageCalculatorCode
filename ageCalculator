// Write your function here:

function howOld(age, year) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear(); //Call the get full year function on the new date function
  const calculatedAge = age + (year - currentYear);

  if (year > currentYear) {
    return `You will be ${calculatedAge} in the year ${year}`;
  } else if (year < currentYear - age) {
    const calculatedYearsBefore = currentYear - age - year;
    return `The year ${year} was ${calculatedYearsBefore} years before you were born`;
  } else {
    return `You were ${calculatedAge} in the year ${year}`;
  }
}

console.log(howOld(42, 2030));




// Once your function is written, write function calls to test your code!
